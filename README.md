I was asked by @moeknows in the discord if there is a tool to see the users followers in detail.
There are tools to show followers, to see dead followers but there was no tool to show users active followers status in detail.
Followers are a very important part of Steemit. I remember @SirCork told me once in his open-mic:
> It is not important what you write, but it is more important who you know for success in Steemit.

* You can sort the list according to given parameters.
The button with "^ " sorts the list in ascending order ( smaller first ) and the button with arrow "v" sorts the list in descending order ( biggest first )
For example pushing the "v" indicated button near user SP will sort the list with the followers with highest SP first.
